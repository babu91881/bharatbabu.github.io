                                This project aimed to analyze the ethanol content present in petrol from various fuel brands and study its impact on vehicle performance and fuel efficiency. With the increasing use of ethanol as a blending agent in petrol to reduce emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, understanding its effect on engine performance becomes crucial. Samples from different brands were collected and tested to determine ethanol concentration using laboratory techniques. The project also involved testing the fuel samples in a controlled engine setup to monitor changes in fuel consumption, engine power output, and emission levels. The results provided insights into how varying ethanol content influences combustion efficiency, engine wear, and overall performance, helping consumers and automobile manufacturers make informed choices regarding fuel selection and engine optimization.</p>

                                <p>This project focuses on the design and structural analysis of a battery casing for automotive applications, aimed at ensuring mechanical strength, thermal stability, and vibration resistance. The design phase was carried out using SolidWorks, where a detailed 3D model of the battery casing was developed, considering factors such as dimensions, material selection, and ease of assembly. The designed casing was then subjected to structural and thermal analysis using ANSYS software to evaluate its strength, stress distribution, deformation, and thermal behavior under real-world operating conditions. The analysis helped in identifying potential weak points and optimizing the design to enhance durability and performance. The project ultimately aims to provide a robust and efficient battery housing that enhances both battery safety and overall vehicle reliability.</p>

                                        I have known Bharat Bharat Babu since his early undergraduate days at SRM Institute of Science and Technology,
                                        where I taught him Physics. From the very beginning, Bharat stood out—not just for his academic performance, but
                                        for his curiosity, respectful demeanor, and grounded personality.While Physics may not be the core of his
                                        specialization in automobile engineering, Bharat never treated it as just another subject. He engaged with concepts
                                        deeply, often asking questions that connected physics principles with real-world automotive systems. His ability to
                                        bridge disciplines—even as a first-year student—was both refreshing and promising.

                                        I am happy to recommend Bharat Bharat Babu, who was one of my students in the Chemistry course at SRMIST. From the very beginning, Bharat demonstrated a natural curiosity and strong dedication to his studies. His ability to grasp complex chemical concepts and relate them to real-world applications was always impressive.Bharat was not only diligent in his approach to learning but also actively participated in class discussions and problem-solving sessions. His analytical thinking, combined with a genuine enthusiasm for learning, allowed him to excel in the course. He always showed a strong commitment to understanding the subject, which I believe will serve him well in his future academic and professional endeavors.
